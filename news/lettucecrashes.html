      <section class="content">
      <p> Over the last one week and one hour, many car crashes have occurred, three and a half, to be precise. </p>
  <p> <i>Where</i>, you ask? Bosnia 😐. </p>
  <p> <i>When</i> you ask? You dunce, I have already answered that <i>(See Sentence N°1)</i>. </p>
  <p> The main suspect of these crimes, to which is considered, is one specific head of lettuce named Nellison &#x27;Nelly&#x27; Hekla. The reason for this is that Hekla has been found fleeing the scene of the crime in every instance. This is condemming evidence for a crime, in my opinion. </p>
  <p> Hekla has been found with blood on their leaves, the blood of which belonged to every single victim, of which will be listed here, in decreasing order of swag: <i>Pompilius Skloggie</i>, <i>Ragna József</i>, <i>Božo Tabby</i>, <i>Fr...</i> </p>
  <p> Blah blah blah. Who wants to hear this? The answer: No-one. </p>
  <p> I ask you, what? What: What do you think? I, <b>General Jansen</b>, for one, think that I am right, as always. </p>
  <p> Hekla <i>(Remember: Is lettuce!)</i> was taken into custody yestermorning, awaiting trial for the death and severe inconvenience of multiple individuals. But I mean, who care? </p>
  <p> As you have probably guessed, a common garden vegetable being responsible for such crimes is outlandish in ones thoughts. </p>
  <p> But NO! Shut up! You silly child! Ugh! Gettaway from me! </p>
  <p> One vegetable in history has been sentenced to death for a similar crime of arson. The vegetable in question, which was never given a name, most likely due to it being a plant, was given the death sentence (Fed to the rats). </p>
  <p> This has been <i>General Jansen</i> with The <b><a href=https://trustworthytimes.github.io> Trustworthy Times  </a></b>, and I hate you. </p>
